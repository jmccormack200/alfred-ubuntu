Note That alfred does not belong to me.

This repo is simply for our version of Alfred that we are using on our Ubuntu machines.

The regular Alfred install was giving us errors with not finding the libcap libraries.

I found the resolution at this site:

http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/42640/cannot-install-a-l-f-r-e-d-on-raspberry-pi-2/42642

Where the libcap flags are removed and more options are presented instead.

If you use this Makefile version of Alfred, using the bash script:

sudo bash ubuntuAlfredInstall.sh

Will configure the installation by installing libcap-dev, libpcap-dev, and denying alfred-gpsd.
Change that file according to the features that you want. 

For further questions on using Alfred, please view the "Original ALFRED README" which is the original readme of this repository.
